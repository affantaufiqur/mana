# Mana Colorscheme for Neovim

A minimal, monochromatic colorscheme for Neovim with LSP and Treesitter support. I just wanted to create my own colorscheme and make this also as practice. More plugin support could be added but for now i'm okay with this.

## Installation

### Using Lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  "affantaufiqur/mana",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
}
```
